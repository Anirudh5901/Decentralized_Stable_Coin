We are going to make a StableCoin that is :

1.Relative Stability: Anchored or pegged to USD($1.00)
    ->Chainlink Price Feed
    ->Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> their $$ equivalent

2.Stability Mechanism(Way we do the minting): Algorithmic(Decentralized)
->People can only mint stablecoin with enough collateral(coded)

3.Collateral type: Exogenous(Crypto):
->wETH(ERC20 version of ETH)
->wBTC(ERC20 version of BTC)
